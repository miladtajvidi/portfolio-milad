                    </h3>
                    <p>
2 weeks ago, Liam Henshaw posted about a book that changed his life!<br>
"Anatomy of a football scout" truly delivers. Jon Cotterill demonstrates the art of being concise, blunt and to the point. Despite the title, I believe that every data analyst that wishes to have a better understanding of football and a sharper eye, should read this book. Even if you're not a technical creature and just love football, you should also give it a try! With its easy and smooth read, it won't disappoint!
<br>
Here are some interesting facts mentioned in the book to whet your appetite!
<br>
1Ô∏è‚É£ The Premier League spent ¬£ 272,220,223 on [agents'] fees between 1st of February 2020 and 2021! <br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ 81 of the 386 goals in the Champions League in season 2019/2020 came from crosses! <br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ RAE (Relative Age Effect) is thought to level out at about 17 years of age!<br>

ü§ì PS: I also found a small inaccuracy in one of the facts! On page 75, it states that Joe Hart measures 1.96m which is 9 cm more than Jordan Pickford, but according to Google (don't blame me!), Jordan is 1.85m which puts him at 11cm less than Heart!

                    <p>
Today, I have a banger for you all! In this post, I want to talk about a certain aspect of data and AI that has been, or still is, eluding most of the "data experts". "Behavioral AI" by Rogayeh is truly captivating. I've never enjoyed a more smooth Wiley-published book than this! Highly recommended for all the stakeholders, product managers, data staff and enthusiasts that are willing to make a bit more sense out of the plethora of data that is spiraling out of control out there!
<br>
üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Rogayeh Tabrizi, PhD
<br>
From a Masters' degree in particle physics, to working at CERN and getting a PhD in economics, Rogayeh has made herself a truly context-aware model generation machine! In this art work of hers, she shows how economic intuition and behavioral economic methods can not only help us to decode the complex patters hidden within the data, but also drive meaningful and impactful decisions. If you've read my previous post regarding the book "Range" and benefits of interdisciplinary methods, this book is for you!
<br>
Let me tell you a short story why it was even more fun for me to read this book. 8 years ago, before switching to computer science from electrical engineering, there was a period I was exploring an option to do a Masters in experimental psychology. To get the minimum requirements, in a short 6-month interval, I studied thousands of pages of undergrad psychology textbooks and I took a GRE psychology subject exam which I ended up being in the 91 percentile! An unbelievable achievement for both me and the professor I was planning on to join his lab. It didn't pay off directly as I had on mind. In the hindsight, another short but learning experience for me that I like to believe it made me a wiser Homo sapien! If you want to get closer to becoming a true Homo economicus, The Behavioral AI is definitely for you!
<br>
 "I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious." [Albert Einstein]
This is the starting quote with which the book embarks us on a short but sweet journey with the author's experiences, thoughts, and reflections. It shouldn't be surprising to find the epilogue also starts with another one of Einstein's quotes:
"Everything must be made as simple as possible. But not simpler."
These can be enough on their own to incentivize any curious soul to check the book out. Regardless, here are some topics and points which I found fascinating:

"There are things that can be measured. There are things that are worth measuring. But what can be measured is not always what is worth measuring; what gets measured may have no relationship to what we really want to know. The costs of measuring may be greater than the benefits. The things that get measured may draw effort away from the things we really care about. And measurement may provide us with distorted knowledge, knowledge that seems solid but is actually deceptive." [From the book]
<br>
In my previous post, I mentioned how David's points reminded me of the "Tyranny of the metrics" by Jerry Muller. I thought it's time to pay our tribute to this great work. According to Muller, it's difficult to pigeonhole this book since it touches upon different paradigms such as public policy, education, philanthropy and much more. But the key theme is how "metric fixation" and overreliance on performance-based measurements can plague us in all those paradigms.

David mentioned clients cases which started with twelve football complicated models and ended up with other complicated models, the key difference, however, was that the clubs understood these models. In "Behavioral AI" by Rogayeh, the power of collaboration between data science teams responsible for metrics and the domain-expert clients that were planning to use those metrics were emphasized. Completing the sacred tertiary orders, "Tyranny of the metrics" helps you understand one of the big reasons why so many contemporary organizations function less well than they ought to, diminishing productivity while frustrating those who work in them!

<br>
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity<br>
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment<br>
Would you capture it or just let it slip? [Eminem]<br>

These lyrics can truly embody the thoughts that may be going through penalty takers minds moments before they step up for their version of Hercules Labors. The same can be told about Geir Jordet. Despite having to face such hardship only twice in his earlier career as a footballer, his curiosity about penalties didn't cease to exist. Even getting challenged by Henning Berg, a legendary figure in Norway's football, didn't stop him but rather made it a lifelong mission of Geir's to delve deep into different aspects of pressure. Years of research, observation, experimentation and myriads of conversations have turned him into the Proteus of penalties and pressure: The main difference? Unlike Proteus, he generously offers years of his insights with us in "Pressure: Lessons From The Pschology Of The Penalty Shootout".
<br>
This comprehensive work covers everything that happens months or years before a penalty shootout such as pressure training, pre-shot routine developments, setting up roles for everyone involved like penalty spot and penalty taker protectors, to huddle location, post-whistle pause, all the way to celebration, post-miss support , and much much more! (even trash talking!) Although there are many famous coaches such as Didier Deschamp who believe penalties are lotteries and aren't worth investing too much time, great success stories and plethora of research mentioned in the book are testaments to the great strength of us to cope under the pressure , be more in control, and execute extraordinary performances despites being human and vulnerable.
<br>
To top it off, I created a repo containing links to almost all of the publicly available cited papers. I've listed them in an ascending order of their published year. <br>

Maybe this feeling of control is not more than a mere illusion and as Oracle said to Neo in "The Matrix Reloaded": You didn't come here to make the choice. You've already made it. You're here to try to understand why you made it!"
Illusion or not, if you want to understand the pressure and the lessons it teaches us, get yourself a copy of pressure!
