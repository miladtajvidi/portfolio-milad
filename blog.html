                    </h3>
                    <p>
2 weeks ago, Liam Henshaw posted about a book that changed his life!<br>
"Anatomy of a football scout" truly delivers. Jon Cotterill demonstrates the art of being concise, blunt and to the point. Despite the title, I believe that every data analyst that wishes to have a better understanding of football and a sharper eye, should read this book. Even if you're not a technical creature and just love football, you should also give it a try! With its easy and smooth read, it won't disappoint!
<br>
Here are some interesting facts mentioned in the book to whet your appetite!
<br>
1Ô∏è‚É£ The Premier League spent ¬£ 272,220,223 on [agents'] fees between 1st of February 2020 and 2021! <br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ 81 of the 386 goals in the Champions League in season 2019/2020 came from crosses! <br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ RAE (Relative Age Effect) is thought to level out at about 17 years of age!<br>

ü§ì PS: I also found a small inaccuracy in one of the facts! On page 75, it states that Joe Hart measures 1.96m which is 9 cm more than Jordan Pickford, but according to Google (don't blame me!), Jordan is 1.85m which puts him at 11cm less than Heart!

                    </h3>
                    <p>
Today, I have a banger for you all! In this post, I want to talk about a certain aspect of data and AI that has been, or still is, eluding most of the "data experts". "Behavioral AI" by Rogayeh is truly captivating. I've never enjoyed a more smooth Wiley-published book than this! Highly recommended for all the stakeholders, product managers, data staff and enthusiasts that are willing to make a bit more sense out of the plethora of data that is spiraling out of control out there!
<br>
üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Rogayeh Tabrizi, PhD
<br>
From a Masters' degree in particle physics, to working at CERN and getting a PhD in economics, Rogayeh has made herself a truly context-aware model generation machine! In this art work of hers, she shows how economic intuition and behavioral economic methods can not only help us to decode the complex patters hidden within the data, but also drive meaningful and impactful decisions. If you've read my previous post regarding the book "Range" and benefits of interdisciplinary methods, this book is for you!
<br>
Let me tell you a short story why it was even more fun for me to read this book. 8 years ago, before switching to computer science from electrical engineering, there was a period I was exploring an option to do a Masters in experimental psychology. To get the minimum requirements, in a short 6-month interval, I studied thousands of pages of undergrad psychology textbooks and I took a GRE psychology subject exam which I ended up being in the 91 percentile! An unbelievable achievement for both me and the professor I was planning on to join his lab. It didn't pay off directly as I had on mind. In the hindsight, another short but learning experience for me that I like to believe it made me a wiser Homo sapien! If you want to get closer to becoming a true Homo economicus, The Behavioral AI is definitely for you!
<br>
 "I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious." [Albert Einstein]
This is the starting quote with which the book embarks us on a short but sweet journey with the author's experiences, thoughts, and reflections. It shouldn't be surprising to find the epilogue also starts with another one of Einstein's quotes:
"Everything must be made as simple as possible. But not simpler."
These can be enough on their own to incentivize any curious soul to check the book out. Regardless, here are some topics and points which I found fascinating:
<br>
‚èπ The concept of MVD (Minimum Viable Data) <br> 
‚èπ Data-centric AI (coined by Andrew Ng) <br>
‚èπ Crafting customer-centric paradigms with behavioral insights<br>
‚èπ Homo economicus, and nudging, "The End of Behavioral Finance", SMarT(Richard Thaler)<br>
‚èπ Loss aversion, framing effect, Dual-process Theory, and Prospect Theory,"Noise" (Kahneman and Tversky)<br>
‚èπ Anchoring effect, choice overload, pain of paying (Dan Ariely)<br>
‚èπ Uber, good and bad nudging, and ethical behavioral economics<br>

                        ü•∫Apparently GitHub doesn‚Äôt allow you to directly change the visibility of a forked repository from public to private.; i.e. If you fork a public repository, your fork must also remain public. Instead, you can first create an empty private repo and then

                        Many data scientists need to convert conda and/or pip environments into Docker images, for collaboration across teams or to move local working environments to run on the cloud. Most people achieve this manually using workflows that can get increasingly
                        elaborate. While this technically works, it‚Äôs not always accessible to everyone.
